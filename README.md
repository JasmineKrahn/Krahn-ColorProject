# Krahn-ColorProject

THE EXE DOES NOT EXECUTE DUE TO THE BITMAPS AND PNGS.

To Log in: Username DDDJ; Password finalProject

To add in owned paint or desired painnt: double click on Add New Paint

To add pictures of paint, file must be a bit map image

To delete a paint, double click on the hexcode

To view a mixture, for the desired colors, add in either (120,60,190) or (200,150,25) for the paint values, then click on the hexcode that pops up

To view paint on an object, you need to have the desired paints (186,220,232) or (245,213,72) in your desired list. Then choose an object after selecting one of those values from within the view paint on object form.

DesiredColors and OwnedColors are both in a conflicted state. I don't know how that will work on your end.
